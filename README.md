References of 2016 Presidential Candidates in Hip-Hop Songs 


Hip-Hop hates Trump but love's Trump's money.

In this app, I am analyzing references of the 2016 presidential candidates in Hip-Hop music from 1989 up until 2016. To do this, I am examining song data from Genius. I am looking to see which candidates were mentioned most, whether or not those references were positive, negative, or neutral, and what exactly was said about the popular candidates. I expect mentions of Trump to not only dominate but also be overwhelmingly negative.

I found that overall, mentions of Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton dominated. Both were mostly negative mentions as well around the time of the election, but something somewhat surprising but understandable in retrospect, is Trump's popularity in rap before running for presidency. He was mentioned extremely often in reference to his fortune and lifestyle, something many rappers admired. Once he began his race to the White House, however, things took a dramatic turn and rappers started to attack him and his politics, far outpacing any references to his billionaire lifestyle. 

The data I used is available for download in my app and repo and is from the popular music and lyric website Genius.
